### Desktop File Cleaner

#### Goals
Making a program that automates the certain processes that I require it to do:
- Remove old files(specifically files and screenshots) from the asked folders
- Categorize files into folders based on their type or extensions
- Copy certain sub-folders and files from a folder into another folder


#### Requirements
- Needs to have an interface to take inputs from the user and execute functions that accomplish the one of the goals
- Needs to be able to run in the background and execute the functions at a particular time
- Should be able to access file system in order to modify it

#### Implementation
- Language used: Python
- Libraries used so far: `os`, `shutil`, `sys`
- Brief explanation of the code

#### Results & Observations
- What I learned
- Did I accomplish the goals
- What I would do differently
