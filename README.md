Making a program that automates the certain processes that I require it to do:

- Categorize files into folders based on their type or extensions
- Copy certain folders and files from a folder into another folder


#### Requirements

    - Aiming for a widget-based interface to be put up on the desktop and can be used whenever needed
- Needs to be able to run in the background and execute the functions at a particular time
- Should be able to access file system in order to modify it

#### Implementation
- Language used: Python
- Libraries used
